		<h2>About Me</h2>
		
		<p> <font size="4">I am a political scientist and public administration scholar whose work focuses on environmental policy. I am an assistant professor at the <a href="https://truman.missouri.edu/" target="_blank">Truman School of Public Affairs</a> at the University of Missouri. Previously, I was employed as an assistant professor at Florida Atlantic University and received my PhD in Political Science from Texas A&M University. </font> </p>

		<p> <font size="4">My work stands at the intersection between political science, public administration, and normative political theory, with an emphasis on water policy. My major research focus is on how political and administrative variables shape the implementation and development of environmental policy at the local level in the United States. My current research agenda is aimed at exploring how water utilities of different organizational structures and ownership models differentially respond to the political, climatological, and demographic environment in which they are situated. I have additional interests in public management, democratic theory, urban policy, and environmental justice. My work has been published in, among other outlets, <i>Public Administration Review</i>, <i>Urban Affairs Review</i>, and <i>Policy Studies Journal</i>. </font> </p>
